This did seem deceptively simple. We used a loop to iterate and check everything in ints.
We initialize the min. and max. as the 1st elements of the array. We find the smallest by simply seeing if the number inside ints is smaller, and find the largest by doing the same thing.

**Time complexity:**
O(n), in the loop we just find the smallest and largest elements.

**Space**

I believe the complexity for this is constant. So, O(1). The input doesn't matter in this case.
